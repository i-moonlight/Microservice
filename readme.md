# What is microservice?
Microservice is modern as well as a popular architectural term for designing software application over the last few years. There are lots of definition on the internet to describe what microservice really is and all of them are correct. But I wanna describe it simply, concisely and more importance is exactly.  

A microservice application is consist of different services where every service is an application and  
  1. **Independently deployable**   
  2. **Independently scalable**  

above two are the key requirements of a microservice application.

In this microservice application here are two service **product-service** and **offer-service** both independently deployable and scaleable. They are also using a different database but this is not an issue about microservice architecture. They can use the same database.

# Run the services

## Prerequisites
### 1. Java 8 and Maven
Java 8 and Maven should be installed on your system and configured with your IDE.

### 2. RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ should be installed and running in your system where product service will be deployed.  
Though this example is for localhost you need to install in your local computer.

#### Install RabbitMQ  
##### [Mac OS]  
Here is **install-rabbitmq-macOS.sh** file to install RabbitMQ type `bash install-rabbitmq-macOS.sh` in your system terminal.  
then start RabbitMQ by typing `rabbitmq-server`.

##### [Ubuntu OS]
Check this for [Installing on Debian and Ubuntu](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-debian.html)

##### [Windows]  
Check this for [Installing on Windows](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html#installer)

### 3. Lombok
Lombok plugin should be installed in you IDE otherwise IDE will catch code error.

## Run Product service
It's a spring boot maven application that's why If maven is installed and configured to your system, application can be run in terminal by
````
cd product-service/
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
````
Otherwise configure your system and open it on your favourite IDE to run.  
This application will start on port **8081**

Access it's data source console in browser by
`localhost:8081/h2`  
To connect product data source h2 console use below credentials   
JDBC URL  : `jdbc:h2:~/product`  
User Name : `root`  
Password  : `root`  

Check product table. Right now there is no products.  
Let's add a new product by calling `localhost:8081/products` POST endpoint with below body
````
{
	"productCode": "ABC1",
	"productTitle": "watch",
	"imageUrl": "watch.img"
}
````
Now check product table and there is a product with product_id is 1 [remember it] and no **discount_offer**.   
We will add it's offer by a event from other application [offer-service]

## Run Offer service
It's also a spring boot maven application and run it similarly as product-service.  
It will run on port **8082**.

Access it's data source console in browser by
`localhost:8082/h2`  
To connect offer data source h2 console use below credentials  
JDBC URL  : `jdbc:h2:~/offer`  
User Name : `root`  
Password  : `root`

Check offer table and there is no offer right now.  
Let's add a offer for product_id=1 by calling `localhost:8082/offer` POST endpoint with below body
````
{
	"productId": 1,
	"discountOffer": 30
}
````
Now check offer table there is a offer recorded added for product_id=1
and product table is updated with 30% discount_offer for product_id=1.

**Note:** Here Offer and Product table are from different data source and running on different port.

## How it's working?
When we add an offer for a product from **offer-service** it pushes an event notification to **product-service** with 
discount_offer and **product-service** update itself by its business logic.


# Tools for maintainable and scalable microservice application design [ Incomplete...]

### Service Discovery [Service Registry]
All microservice instances will register with a naming server for service registraton. When a service wants 
to use another service, it will ask to naming server what instances are currently running. Server will check
the instances and pass the request to the instance. This is called service discovery.
The advantage is s service registry always updates itself, if one instance goes down, 
it removes it from its registry.
- Eureka
- Zookeeper
- Consul

### Load Balancing [Client Side]
Multiple instances of a services will be distriduted to calling services.
if one microservice wants to communicate with another microservice, 
it generally ask the service registry which returns all the instances of the 
called microservice to the calling service. Then it is calling service headache 
which instance it will call. This is the process of client side load balancing.
- Ribbon

### Polyglot Systems [set a non java application with Eureka and Ribbon ]
- Sidecar
    - Sidecar is a project inspired by Netflix Prana and, as its name suggests, requires you
      to start an instance of this application appendix per non-Java application
      instance for which you want to use Ribbon and Eureka.

### API Gateway
It itself a service for facing clients. Just like the entry point to get any service.
Receive all the request and delegates the request to the appropriate service.
Like a gatekeeper.
- Zuul


### Intra Communication among Microservices
Invoking other microservices via http proxy request.
- REST Templete
- Feign
  - Developers donâ€™t have to bother about REST internal details. Encoding request and 
Decoding reponse are automatically maintained by Feign.

### Distributed Tracing
Simply the centralized log for all services to tracing complete chain of what happened 
in a specific request. Centralized information container for all the services.
- Spring cloud sleuth 
  - Tracing every request by assigning an unique id to every request so that the request can be identified
inside every services.
- RabbitMQ 
  - The Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) which put all services log in one message queue 
and send it to tracing server like Zipkin. All services are connected with RabbitMQ.
- Zipkin
  - The server application for visualizing what happens on the specific request.
